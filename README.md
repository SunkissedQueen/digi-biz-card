## Creating the Digital Business Card

### Step 1: HTML Structure

First, create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and add the following code to create the basic structure of your business card.    
_Explanations of html code are encapsulated in <!--  -->._  
```html
<!-- html section: declares the document type and language. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<!-- head section: contains metadata, title, and link to the CSS file -->
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Digital Business Card</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

<!-- body section: contains the main content that is displayed on the web page -->
<body>

    <!-- a container for the profile content -->
    <div class="business-card">

        <!-- displays the profile picture -->
        <div class="header">
        <img src="profile-picture.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-img">

        <!-- displays the name, a short bio, contact info -->
        <h1>Your Name</h1>
        <p class="job-title">Your Job Title</p>
        <div class="contact-info">
            <p>Email:

                <!-- mailto creates a link that opens in the user's email program to let them send an email to the designated email address -->
                <a href="mailto:youremail@outlook.com" target="_blank">
                  youremail@outlook.com
                </a>
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- contains links to social profiles with icons -->
        <div class="social-links">
            <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>
            <a href="https://github.com/yourusername" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 2: CSS Styling

Next, create a CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) and add the following code to style your business card.  
_CSS allows you to style HTML elements to control their appearance on web pages._  
_Explanations of css code are encapsulated in /*  */._    
```css
/* selector { */
  /* property: value */
/* } */

/* html tag selector */
/* centers the content and applies basic styling */
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

/* unique class name selector denoted with .business-card */
/* class="business-card" assign on the html file as an attribute on a html tag  */
.business-card {
    background-color: #fff;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    padding: 20px;
    max-width: 300px;
    text-align: center;
}

/* makes the profile image circular */
.profile-img {
    border-radius: 50%;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    object-fit: cover;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 1.5em;
    margin: 10px 0;
}

.job-title, .contact-info {
    margin: 5px 0;
    color: #555;
}

/* nested selector allow you to apply styles to elements based on their hierarchy in the HTML */
.social-links a {
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 10px;
    text-decoration: none;
    color: #0077b5;
}

/* pseudo-class selector allow you to style elements based on user interaction */
.social-links a:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```
